You can also specify sheet ranges via A1 notation:

A1 Notation
This is a string like Sheet1!A1:B2, that refers to a group of cells in the spreadsheet, and is typically used in
formulas. For example, valid ranges are:

    Sheet1!A1:B2 refers to the first two cells in the top two rows of Sheet1.
    Sheet1!A:A refers to all the cells in the first column of Sheet1.
    Sheet1!1:2 refers to the all the cells in the first two rows of Sheet1.
    Sheet1!A5:A refers to all the cells of the first column of Sheet 1, from row 5 onward.
    A1:B2 refers to the first two cells in the top two rows of the first visible sheet.
    Sheet1 refers to all the cells in Sheet1.
    If the sheet name has spaces or starts with a bracket, surround the sheet name with single quotes ('), e.g
    'Sheet One'!A1:B2. For simplicity, it is safe to always surround the sheet name with single quotes.
